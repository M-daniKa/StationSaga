STATION:
Station 5

JONA_DIALOGUE:
It's hot today, isn't it? Drink some lemonade.
Because I have some bad news for you…

EXPLANATION:
Looks like everyone wants to get out of the heat!
How about we add one more train car, Cap?

JONA_DIALOGUE:
That new car joined in real quick.
Linked lists are great when you need to add things without breaking everything.
The previous tail's pointer now points to this new car, and this new car's pointer points to null, making it the new tail.

EXPLANATION:
There we go, perfect!
Passengers are now boarding…

JONA_DIALOGUE:
New data going into the new node, simple as that.

EXPLANATION:
Well, you still have some lemonade right?
We might have another problem on our hands…
We need to sort these train cars from lightest to heaviest for a better traveling experience.
To do that, click the swap button below!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Watch closely, this is where it gets interesting.
The cars aren't disappearing, they're just switching places.
That's swapping nodes by changing the links between them.
What happens is: we compare two nodes, and if they're out of order, we change the pointers around them.
The node before them changes its pointer to skip one and point to the other.
Then we rearrange the pointers of the swapped nodes so they link correctly in their new positions.
The nodes themselves don't move in memory, just the connections between them change.

EXPLANATION:
Done! That looks much better now.
Ready to roll to the final station?

STATION:
Station 5.5

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Wait, hold on a second!
Before we get to the final station, there's one more thing you should know.

EXPLANATION:
What if we need to add a train car in the middle of the train, not at the end?
Let's say between Car 2 and Car 3?

EXPLANATION:
Click the insert button and choose where to place the new car!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Okay, here's the tricky part.
When you insert in the middle, you can't just slap it in there.
First, we need to find the position by traversing from the head to the node before where we want to insert.
Then, the new car's pointer points to what the previous car was pointing to (Car 3).
After that, the previous car's pointer (Car 2) changes to point to the new car instead.
If we did it the other way around, we'd lose the connection to the rest of the train!
That's why order matters when inserting into a linked list.

EXPLANATION:
See that? The train is still connected, just with a new car in the middle!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Insertion in the middle is one of linked lists' superpowers.
In arrays, you'd have to shift everything, but here? Just change two pointers and you're done.

EXPLANATION:
Now you're really ready for the final station!
