DIALOGUE:
It’s hot today, isn’t it?
Better grab some lemonade and stay hydrated.

Because… I’ve got some bad news for you.
Looks like everyone wants to escape the heat at the same time!

That means we need more space.
How about we add one more train car, Cap?

To add a new train car, click the add button below!

Nice! That new car joined the train almost instantly.
This is one of the big strengths of linked lists.
They let us add new things without breaking the rest of the train.

Here’s what just happened behind the scenes.
The previous tail’s pointer was updated to point to this new car.
The new car’s pointer points to null, since nothing comes after it.

That officially makes this new car the tail of the train.
There we go — perfect!

Passengers are now boarding…
New data is being stored inside the new node, simple as that.

Still got some lemonade left?
Good… because we might have another problem on our hands.

The train is getting uneven again.
For a smoother ride, we need to sort these train cars from lightest to heaviest.

To sort the train, click the swap button below!

Watch closely — this is where things get interesting.
The train cars aren’t disappearing or being recreated.
They’re simply swapping places.

This is called swapping nodes by changing the links between them.

Here’s how swapping works.
We compare two neighboring nodes.
If they’re out of order, we swap them by rearranging their pointers.

The node before them updates its pointer to skip one node and point to the other.
Then, the swapped nodes update their own pointers so they connect correctly in their new positions.

The important thing to remember is this.
The nodes themselves do not move in memory.
Only the connections between them change.

And just like that… swap complete!
That looks much better now.

The train is sorted and balanced again.
Ready to roll to the next stop?

STATION:
Station 5.5

DIALOGUE:
Wait — hold on just a second!
Before we reach the final station, there’s one more important thing you need to know.

What if we want to insert a train car in the middle of the train, not just add it at the end?
For example, between Car 2 and Car 3?

To insert a train car in the middle, click the insert button and choose where to place it!

Alright, here’s the tricky part.
When we insert in the middle, we can’t just drop the car anywhere.

First, we traverse the train starting from the head.
We stop at the node before the position where we want to insert.

Next, the new car’s pointer is set to point to what the previous car was pointing to.
In this case, that would be Car 3.

After that, the previous car’s pointer — Car 2 — is updated to point to the new car instead.

The order of these steps is extremely important.
If we updated the previous car’s pointer first, we would lose access to the rest of the train!

That’s why insertion in a linked list must be done carefully and in the correct sequence.

See that?
The train is still fully connected, just with a brand-new car inserted in the middle.

Insertion is one of a linked list’s true superpowers.
In arrays, you’d have to shift everything over.
Here, we just change two pointers.

Now that means you’re truly ready for the final station!
