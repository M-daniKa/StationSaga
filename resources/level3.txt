DIALOGUE:
It’s hot today, isn’t it?
Better grab some lemonade and stay hydrated.

Because… I’ve got some bad news for you.
Looks like everyone wants to escape the heat at the same time!

That means we need more space.
How about we put in one more train car, Cap?

To add a new train car, click the add button below!

Nice! That new car joined the train almost instantly.
This is one of the big strengths of linked lists.
They let us add new things without breaking the rest of the train.

Here’s what just happened behind the scenes.
The previous tail’s pointer was updated to point to this new car.
The new car’s pointer points to null, since nothing comes after it.

That officially makes this new car the tail of the train.
There we go — perfect!

Passengers are now boarding…
New data is being stored inside the new node, simple as that.

Still got some lemonade left?
Good… because we might have another problem on our hands.

The train is getting uneven again.
For a smoother ride, we need to sort these train cars from lightest to heaviest.

The train cars aren’t disappearing or being recreated.
They’re simply swapping places.

This is called swapping nodes by changing the links between them to arrange them.

Here’s how swapping works.
We compare two neighboring nodes.
If they’re out of order, we exchange them by rearranging their pointers.

The node before them updates its pointer to skip one node and point to the other.
Then, the swapped nodes update their own pointers so they connect correctly in their new positions.

The important thing to remember is this.
The nodes themselves do not move in memory.
Only the connections between them change.

And just like that… sorting complete!
That looks much better now.

The train is sorted and balanced again.

Now that means you’re truly ready for the final destination! See you at the quiz area!
