STATION:
Station 3

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Look at you! Already knowing how to delete and add!
All this tells me is that you're ready for Station 3!
Let's hop into the action!

EXPLANATION:
Oh no, I just checked and the train seems to be imbalanced…
We need to search through the train cars to see how many passengers are in each one.
Are you ready?
To start searching, click the search and edit button below!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Now we're checking each train car one by one.
Linked lists can't skip ahead like arrays can, they have to check things in order.
We start at the head, the first car, and follow each pointer to the next car until we've checked them all.
This is called traversal, we're traversing through the linked list sequentially.

EXPLANATION:
Searching…
Search Done!
Train Car 2 has exceeded its full capacity!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
There it is, found the problem.
Each train car holds data, like how many passengers it has.
That data is stored inside the node, separate from the pointer.
And this one's carrying way too much weight.

EXPLANATION:
We need to move some passengers to the other train cars to keep it balanced!
Click the values above the train cars to edit them!
Good job, that's much better!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Perfect work there.
You didn't change the train structure, just what's inside the car.
That's editing data inside a node.
The node structure stayed the same, the pointers didn't change, only the data value changed.

EXPLANATION:
Looks like we're ready to move on to the next station.
Shall we?

STATION:
Station 4

JONA_DIALOGUE:
You have arrived at Station 4! Bit chilly, eh?

EXPLANATION:
We ran into something… Not a person, but a problem.
We might be stuck here for a bit unless we solve it.
Let's check the capacity of the train again.
To do that, click the search and edit button below!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Same thing as before, another traversal.
We search through the list and check each car again, starting from the head.
Following each pointer, one by one, until we reach the tail.
This is how linked lists work, they need to traverse sequentially to access data.

EXPLANATION:
Calculating…
Same problem that we had before! Too many people in one train car!
You know what to do!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Déjà vu, right? But that's good practice.
Linked lists love repetition: search, find, fix.
Again, we're only changing the data inside the node, not the structure of the list itself.

EXPLANATION:
I knew you could do it! Ready for Station 5?
Let's go!
