LEVEL:

STATION:
Station 3

DIALOGUE:
Good job doing the last level!
That tells me you’re more than ready for Station 3.
Let’s hop straight into the action!

Oh no… I just checked the control panel, and the train seems a bit imbalanced.
Some cars may be carrying more passengers than others.

We need to look for the overloaded cars and fix them.
To do that we have to look at each train car one by one.
Linked lists can’t jump directly to a car like arrays can.
Instead, they must move step by step.

We always start at the head, the very first car.
From there, we follow the pointer to the next car, then the next, and so on.

This process is called traversal.
To find these cars, we traverse the entire train, inspecting each car’s data.

Each train car holds data, such as how many passengers it contains.
This data lives inside the node and is separate from the pointer.

To fix this, we first need to search through the train. Click the search and edit button below!

Nice work — that already looks much better!
Perfect job there.

Notice what you changed.
You didn’t put in or pull out any train cars.

You only edited the data inside a node.
The node’s structure stayed the same.
The pointers didn’t change — only the stored value did.

That’s an important idea in linked lists.
We can search for data and modify it without touching the list’s structure.

Looks like we’re ready to move on to the next station.
Shall we?

STATION:
Station 4

DIALOGUE:
You have arrived at Station 4!
Bit chilly, eh?

Passengers have exited the train, and new ones have boarded.
With all that movement, the passenger count has changed again.

Oh no… we’ve run into a familiar problem.
Some train cars may now be carrying more passengers than others.

To make sure everything is balanced, let’s traverse the train again.
Just like before, we inspect each train car one by one.

We always begin at the head then we follow each pointer until we reach the tail.

This is how linked lists work.
They must move sequentially to inspect their data.

Click the search and edit button below to find and fix the overloaded car.

The unseated passengers have moved to less crowded cars.
Fantastic job!

Reminder! We’re only changing the data stored inside the node.
The structure of the linked list remains untouched.

Great job!
The train is balanced once more, and we’re ready to continue our journey.
