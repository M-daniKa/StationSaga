Station 1

DIALOGUE:
Seems like our Station is empty. No trains, no passengers, nothing at all.
That’s because we haven’t created any train cars yet.
Let’s fix that by creating one.
To add a train car, click the add button below!

See that? You just created your first train car.
In computer terms, this train car is called a node.

A node is made up of two important parts.
The first part is the data, which represents the passengers or information stored in the car.
The second part is a pointer, which is like an arrow that tells us where the next train car is.

Right now, this node’s pointer isn’t pointing to any other car.
When a pointer points to nothing, we call that null.

Since this is the only car in the train, it plays two roles at once.
It is the head, meaning the first car in the list.
It is also the tail, meaning the last car in the list.

That worked but one train car won’t be enough to carry all these passengers.
We’re going to need more. Add another one.

Good Job! One more would be great. Go ahead and add another train car.

You know what? For safety reasons, let’s add one more car to the train.

Great! The new car is now connected to the first one.
The previous tail updated its pointer to point to this new car.
The new car is now the tail of our train.
Its pointer is pointing to null, because nothing comes after it yet.

That connection between nodes is what makes this a linked list.
Each car knows exactly which car comes next.
The list grows one car at a time.
Each node stores data and a pointer to the next node.

There we go! Not bad at all, Captain.
Our train is fully connected and ready to go.
The train is about to head to the next station.
Let’s meet them there.

STATION:
Station 2

DIALOGUE:
Welcome to Station 2! Ready to keep things moving?

Uh oh… we may have miscalculated the number of passengers.
It looks like one of these train cars is completely empty.

Carrying an empty car isn’t very efficient.
To delete a train car, click the delete button below!

Nice move, that was clean.
When you remove a train car, the rest of the train stays connected.

The car before the removed one updated its pointer.
Instead of pointing to the removed car, it now points to the next one.

The removed car is no longer part of the train or the linked list.
Even though a car was removed, the chain remains intact.
That’s one of the biggest advantages of linked lists.

Perfect, you’re really getting the hang of this now!
You’ve seen how to add nodes and delete nodes while keeping the list intact.
Good job!
