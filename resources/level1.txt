STATION:
Station 1

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Seems like our Station is empty, must be because we have no trains.
Let's add one!

EXPLANATION:
To add a train car, click that small add button below!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
See that? You just added your first train car.
In computer terms, that's called a node.
Think of a node like a box that holds two things: the data (like passengers) and a pointer to the next train car.
Right now, your node's pointer is pointing to nothing, because there's no next car yet.
We call this null, and this car is both the head and the tail of your linked list.

EXPLANATION:
That worked! But one train won't be enough.
We're gonna need more! To add another train car, click the add button again.

JONA_DIALOGUE:
And now the new car is connected to the first one.
Here's what just happened: the first car's pointer, which was pointing to null, now points to this new car.
The new car becomes the tail of our train, and its pointer points to null now.
That connection between nodes is what makes this a linked list, not just random cars sitting around.

EXPLANATION:
Perhaps another one? Seems like there's a lot of passengers today.

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Look at that line of cars growing.
Every time you add one at the end, it links itself to the chain.
What's happening is: the previous tail car updates its pointer to point to this new car, and this new car becomes the new tail.
That's how linked lists grow, one car at a time, each one pointing to the next.

EXPLANATION:
There we go! Not bad, Captain.
The train is about to head to the next station.
Let's meet them there, shall we?

STATION:
Station 2

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Welcome to Station 2! Ready to hop into the fun?

EXPLANATION:
Uh oh… We may have miscalculated the amount of passengers!
There's one train car that's completely unoccupied.
How about we delete it for now?
To delete the train car, click the delete button below!

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Nice move, that was clean.
When you delete a train car, the rest don't just fall apart.
Here's what happened: the car before the deleted one changed its pointer to skip over the deleted car and point to the car that came after it.
The deleted car gets removed from memory, but the chain stays connected.
The list just reconnects itself like nothing happened, that's the beauty of pointers.

EXPLANATION:
Perfect, you're getting the hang of this!
Ready to roll to Station 3?
