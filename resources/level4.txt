DIALOGUE:
You're at the last station, Captain!
Since this is your final stop, I’ll let you call the shots on one thing: sorting.

Do you want the train cars with the most passengers up front?
Or would you rather have them in the back?

It’s the same train.
The same cars.
We’re just rearranging them from highest to lowest, or lowest to highest.

That process is called sorting a linked list.

To sort the train cars, click the swap button below!

Here’s how sorting works in a linked list.
We can’t jump around or access cars directly.
Instead, we traverse the list starting from the head.

We compare one node with the next node.
If the two nodes are out of order based on our chosen rule, we swap them.

In a linked list, swapping doesn’t mean copying or moving data around in memory.
It means changing the pointers that connect the nodes.

The node before the pair updates its pointer.
Then the two swapped nodes update their own pointers so they connect to the correct neighbors.

We repeat this process again and again.
Traverse the list.
Compare nodes.
Swap when necessary.

Eventually, we make a full pass through the list without finding anything out of order.
That’s how we know the entire list is sorted.

It’s worth noting that there’s another option.
We could sort by moving the data values inside the nodes instead.

But swapping the actual node connections is more true to how linked lists really work.
Linked lists shine when we manipulate connections, not memory positions.

You truly outdid yourself today.
Fantastic work, Captain!
