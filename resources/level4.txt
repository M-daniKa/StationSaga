JONA_DIALOGUE:
You're at the last station, Captain!
I knew you could do it!
The trick with life is when you feel like giving up, don't.
It might not get better immediately, but at least you won't be in the same place!

EXPLANATION:
Since this is your last station, I'll let you call the shots on one thing: sorting!
You get to decide if you want the train cars with the most passengers up in front, or in the back.

JONA_DIALOGUE:
Same train, same cars, just arranged from highest to lowest.
That's sorting a linked list.
We compare each pair of nodes by traversing the list, and when two are out of order, we swap them by changing the pointers.
We keep doing this until the entire list is sorted from highest to lowest.
The data could also be moved instead of swapping nodes, but swapping the actual node connections is more true to how linked lists work.
Well, Captain… You've been a very good train driver!
From adding at the end, to inserting in the middle, to deleting nodes, to traversing and searching, to editing data, and finally to sorting.
You've learned that linked lists are all about connections.
Each node only knows about the next one, and that's enough to build something powerful.
You really outdid yourself today, good job!

EXPLANATION:
Congratulations on completing Station Saga!
You now understand the fundamentals of linked lists!
