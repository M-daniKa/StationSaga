DIALOGUE:
You're at the last station, Captain!
Since this is your last station, I'll let you call the shots on one thing: sorting!

Do you want the train cars with the most passengers up front?
Or would you rather have them in the back?

It’s the same train.
The same cars.
We’re just rearranging them from highest to lowest (or lowest to highest).

That process is called sorting a linked list.

Here’s how sorting works in a linked list.
We can’t jump around or access cars directly.
So instead, we traverse the list from the head, comparing nodes along the way.

We compare one node with the next node.
If the two nodes are out of order based on our chosen rule, we swap them.

But in a linked list, swapping doesn’t mean copying or moving data around in memory.
It means changing the pointers that connect the nodes.

The node before the pair updates its pointer.
The two nodes update their pointers to correctly link to their new neighbors.

We repeat this process over and over.
Traverse the list.
Compare nodes.
Swap when necessary.

We keep doing this until we can make a full pass through the list without finding anything out of order.
That’s how we know the entire list is sorted from highest to lowest.

It’s worth noting that there’s another option.
We could just move the data values inside the nodes instead of swapping the nodes themselves.

But swapping the actual node connections is more true to how linked lists really work.
Linked lists shine when we manipulate connections, not memory positions.

You truly outdid yourself today.
Fantastic work, Captain!
